I'm working on a blogging app and need to experiment with, beforehand, frontend text editing libraries.

Experimenting with:

+   QuillJS [/quill-notes](#quill)
+   Editor.js [/editorjs-notes](#editor.js)
+   TinyMCE [/tiny-notes](/tiny-notes)

## Notes

`Important!` Sanitaization needs to be done for all editors, frontend and backend.

Make sure to list features the app's editor will need and dive deeper. For instance, images. The only thing achieved is experimenting with the data interchange format: starting, saving, displaying and continuing..

### Quill

In a moment

### Editor.js

1.  Disntictively customisable. If I was looking for what to customise to my exact specifications, Editor.js will be it. The writing (input) and display (output) process both.
2.  Asynchronous events. Those could really come in handy in an SPA.
